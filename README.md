# CI setup angular project for unit/browser testing

Developers find it hard to set up some test around Angular. For no reason.
This project contains some simple examples on

* [ ] Build/minify js
* [ ] Run unit-tests
* [ ] Run browser test
* [ ] Run in CI (Travis, Codeship, CircleCI, whatever)
* [ ] Linting js/css with proper tools

The checkmarks are meant to be checked whenever that feature is implemented
in the code.

## Usage
This project is meant to be used as a template for your Angular app, so that it's easy
to add tests to an existing project.
